## Introduction:
During the covid-19 epidemic a lote of data were collected about covid-19 therefore i tried to make this repo using covid-19 Chest X-ray data and using deep convolution neural network model for  Chest X-ray medical images screening and detecting covid-19.


## Dataset:

1. The posstive cases of COVID-19 X-ray images taken from Dr. Cohen in his 
[repo](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)
2. The normal cases taken from dataset that's published in Kaggle's dataset 
[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data#).

## Result
* The accuracy for both models is above 95% accuracy on the validation set.
